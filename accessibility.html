                Access to any company’s website can be challenging for persons having certain disabilities. A person’s disability is often unique. What may work well for one person, may cause difficulties for another person. Our company has made efforts to accommodate as many of our customers and potential customers as is reasonable given our size, resources, and knowledge of our customers, and potential customer’s needs. To that end we have engaged the services of professionals to assist and advise us in these matters.

            <h2>Some Specific Accessibility Features within this website</h2>
            <p>
                This website contains a third-party plugin, also known as a Widget, called UserWay Website Accessibility (“UserWay”), which is powered by this third party’s dedicated accessibility server. Use of this Widget can improve website access for some users, particularly related to certain type of disabilities. UserWay has stated that its application makes efforts to follow to some degree the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1). On our website, the UserWay widget is located in the BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER of most pages.
            </p>
            <h2>Enabling the Accessibility Menu</h2>
            <p>
                The accessibility menu can be enabled by clicking the accessibility menu icon that appears after clicking on the Widget described above. After triggering the accessibility menu, please wait a moment for the accessibility menu to load in its entirety.
            </p>
            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                We anticipate that from time to time, within our resources, we will be making modifications to parts of our website, and possibly modifications to accessibility of our website. Reasonable efforts toward improving seamless, accessible, and unhindered use of websites by customers and potential customers is generally a worthwhile goal. Moving closer to this goal will often depend on the knowledge the company has regarding any particular difficulties those using the website might encounter, as well as available resources and improvements with technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the efforts we may have made regarding accessibility, consistent with normal business practices for a company of our size and resources, some content, features, processes, or policies, may be improved, so we welcome your suggestions.
